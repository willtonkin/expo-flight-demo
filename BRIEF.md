# Flight Booking Challenge

## Expectations

The challenge is designed to mimic a realistic work assignment:

1. **Creativity** : This assignment doesn't have a singular correct solution. We are excited to see
    your unique approach.
2. **Conceptual thinking** : If you don't have time to build the entire app, we'd still like to
    understand your vision.
3. **Communication** : Be ready to explain your design decisions, your approach to structuring
    code, and your thought process.
4. **Collaboration** : Like in a real work scenario, you can use any available resources. "Cheating"
    is allowed - feel free to use libraries, frameworks, StackOverflow, etc. We're more interested
    in how you solve problems than in testing your memory.

## Timeframe

You have 5 hours to complete this challenge. This is not a hard deadline but an estimate of how
much time you should put in. We're not just looking for what you achieve but also how you
manage your time.

## Submission

Send us a link to your Github repo. We look forward to seeing your unique solutions! Good luck! If
you need any help, please let us know.

## The Challenge

The task is to build a flight booking mobile app. We won't expect to go on a trip after using your
app, but we want the following functionality:

1. Be able to choose if you want a one-way trip or a return-flight
2. Be able to select the dates you wish to travel
3. Be able to choose specific flights available
4. A summary of your itinerary

We provide you with flight data in JSON format. Use this as your source.

```
The dataset contains flights from 2023-09-01 to 2023-09-
The dataset contains flights between Copenhagen and Oslo, and Stockholm and Oslo.
```
**Technical requirements**


1. A React Native app running on your iOS and/or Android device for the demo - we use Expo,
    but you are free to use vanilla React Native
2. Use TypeScript - it's up to you how much you utilise the type system in your solution
